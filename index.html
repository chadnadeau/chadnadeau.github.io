        <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my time in the Computer Science program, I have developed a strong foundation of technical knowledge and practical skills that have not only shaped my professional goals but also prepared me to succeed in the ever-evolving tech industry. The coursework has been instrumental in honing my understanding of essential concepts such as data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security, all of which are integral to my development as a well-rounded computer scientist. For instance, my experience with implementing various data structures, such as trees and graphs, in both theoretical and practical projects allowed me to understand their real-world applications, from optimizing algorithms to improving system performance. Moreover, working with databases and mastering SQL queries equipped me with the skills to design and manage complex systems and applications, ensuring scalability and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development of my ePortfolio has been a crucial part of reflecting on and showcasing my growth as a computer scientist. Working independently on all aspects of my projects required a high level of personal discipline, time management, and the ability to remain focused under pressure. Throughout the program, I learned to set realistic goals, break complex problems into manageable tasks, and consistently meet deadlines without external oversight—skills that are essential for both individual contributors and remote team members in the modern workforce. Completing projects solo also helped sharpen my ability to document and communicate my technical decisions clearly, ensuring that stakeholders could understand the value and structure of my work without needing in-depth technical knowledge. My portfolio highlights these experiences through a range of technical artifacts, including software applications, database designs, and security-focused solutions, each of which demonstrates my ability to independently design, implement, and deliver high-quality results.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I prepare to transition into the workforce, the skills I’ve acquired, along with my ePortfolio, will serve as a comprehensive representation of my abilities. This portfolio not only illustrates my competence in technical areas but also my capacity for critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. It acts as a cohesive narrative of my journey through the program, reflecting my strengths and aspirations, and positioning me as a competitive candidate in the job market. With a clear understanding of both the technical and collaborative aspects of the field, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to any team or project in the future.
